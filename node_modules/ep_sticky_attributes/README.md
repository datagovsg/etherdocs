# How can I bold/italic/underline upcoming text in Etherpad?

## Is there a way that one can bold upcoming text in Etherpad? For example, I want to press ctrl+b, and start typing in Bold. Then press ctrl+b again and go to normal formatting.

# Yes!

Use the Etherpad plugin installer to install the Sticky Attributes plugin

Enjoy!
